ansible-ssh
-----------

This program invokes ssh with the same arguments that ansible does to
connect to hosts defined in its inventory:

    inventory:
        foo ansible_ssh_host=x.y.z ansible_ssh_user=foo â€¦

    $ ansible-ssh foo

Using it saves having to duplicate information from the inventory into
~/.ssh/config files in order to ssh to them interactively.

There's an independent ansible-shell program that tries to execute
ansible modules on multiple hosts in parallel. This program has nothing
to do with that. It just lets you ssh to ONE host using information from
the Ansible inventory.

Note that the "ssh_extra_args" PR against the ansible repository would
make it possible to configure per-host or per-group ProxyCommands to use
jump hosts. We could support that in this program already, but it would
be of limited use until the PR is merged upstream since ansible itself
would not be able to connect to those hosts otherwise.

The initial prototype of this code was written by Carlos Chapi. It's
still pretty rough around the edges, but the basic functionality works.

This code is released under the MIT license.
